This is an interpreter for the Anna language. Anna is a statically
duck typed language a C-like syntax, but which supports LISP-style
macros. In fact, all special purpose constructs like while loops, are
implemented using macros. Anna allows the creation of new features
like using-blocks, with-blocks and exceptions with the block syntax
you'd expect from a C-like language, simply by defining your own
macros.

The Anna interpreter is currently rather incomplete, but supports
enough of the basic features to serve as a proof of concept. Check
back soon for an almost working system, or drop me an email if you
wish to help out.
