This is an interpreter for the Anna language. Anna is a statically
duck typed language with some C-like qualities, but which supports
LISP-style macros. In fact, all special purpose constructs like while
loops, if statements and so on are implemented using macros. Anna
allows the creation of features like using-blocks, with-blocks and
exceptions with the block syntax you'd expect from a C-like language.

The Anna interpreter is currently rather incomplete, but supports
enough of the basic features to serve as a proof of concept. Check
back soon for an almost working system, or drop me an email if you
wish to help out.
