This is an interpreter for the Anna language. Anna is a computer
language with a C-like syntax, structural typing and LISP-style
macros. Anna allows the creation of new features like using-blocks,
with-blocks and exceptions with the block syntax you'd expect from a
C-like language, simply by defining your own macros.

The Anna interpreter is working and only has a small number of glaring
functionality holes, but the standard library is still a barren
wasteland. Check out the various example files in util, perf ans tests
to get a feel for how the language looks.
