This is an interpreter for the Anna language. Anna is a computer
language with a C-like syntax, structural typing and LISP-style
macros. 

The Anna interpreter is working and only has a small number of glaring
functionality holes, but the standard library is still a barren
wasteland. After installing Anna, the documentation should be
available in HTML format in /usr/local/share/doc/anna/index.html. You
can also check out the various example files in the util, perf and
tests directories to get a feel for how the language works.
