  This should result in a compile time error. myFunTemplate is a

  function it points to, and we only perform template specialization
  at compile time. Therefore, this code will fail.

  It would be possible to implement run time specialization, but it is
  felt that the drawbacks of masking various bugs is larger than the
  benefit of making run time creation of new function types easier.
