	    Step one in learning Anna is installing Anna on your computer:
	  </p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>
	      If you're running Ubuntu, click <a href='#install-ubuntu'>here</a>.
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      If your operating system is not listed above, please
	      follow thr <a href='#install-generic'>generic
		guidlines</a>, making note of the exact steps you had
	      to
	      take. Please <a href='mailto:axel+anna@liljencrantz'>email
		me</a> the steps you took to get Anna up and running.
	    </li>
	  </ul>
	    
	  <h2><a name="install-ubuntu">Installing Anna under Ubuntu</a></h2>
	  <p>
	    The first step of installing Anna is to install the various prerequisites. On the command line, enter the following command:
	  </p>
	  <pre>
sudo apt-get install gcc bison flex libgmp3-dev make gettext git-core
	  </pre>
	  <p>
	    The next step is to download the Anna source:
	  </p>
	  <pre>
git clone git://github.com/liljencrantz/anna.git
	  </pre>
	  <p>
	    After that, you'll need to compile Anna:
	  </p>
	  <pre>
cd anna; make -s
	  </pre>
	  <p>
	    If everything went well, you should now have compiled the
	    Anna executable. To install it, type:
	  </p>
	  <pre>
sudo make install
	  </pre>
	  <p>
	    That should be everything you need to get Anna installed
	    on your system. <a href='#hello'>Click here to proceed

	  <p>
	    The first step of installing Anna is to install the
	    various prerequisites. Anna should compile using a
	    resonably modern version of either GCC or LLVM, and
	    requires Flex, Bison, GMP (the GNU Multiple Precision
	    arithmetic library), GNU make and GNU gettext. The Anna
	    source code is version controlled using git, so you will
	    need that as well. Hos to install these prerequisites
	    depends on what platform you're using, please consult you
	    operating system documentation if you're unsure.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    The next step is to download the Anna source:

	  <pre>

	    After that, you'll need to compile Anna:
	  </p>
	  <pre>
cd anna; make -s
	  </pre>
	  <p>
	    If everything went well, you should now have compiled the
	    Anna executable. To install it, run <code>make
	    install</code> as root.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    That should be everything you need to get Anna installed

	  </p>

	  <h1><a name="hello">Hello world</a></h1>
	  <p>
	    The first Anna example will simply write the words «Hello
	    world» on the screen:
	  </p>
	  <pre class="anna-code">
def main()
{
    print("Hello, world!");
}
	  </pre>
	  <p>
	    Let's go over this example in detail.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    First of all, all Anna code consists of
	    functions. Functions are self contained pieces of code. To
	    define a function, you write something
	    like <code class="anna-code">def
	    functionName(){...}</code>.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    The second thing to learn is that when executing a
	    program, the function named main will be executed.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Finally, we've learned that there is a function
	    named <code>print</code>, that will output its arguments
	    to the screen.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    <em class="task">Exercise 1:</em> Save the example above
	    in a file titles <code>hello.anna</code> and try running
	    it by executing the command <code>anna hello</code> from
	    the directory where you saved your file.
	  </p>


	  <h1><a name="variables">Numbers, variables and arithmetic</a></h1>
	  <p>
	    Our next example is a program that holds a simple conversation with the user:
	  </p>
	  <pre class="anna-code">
def main()
{
    print("What is your name?");
    // The io.readLine function reads one line of input from the keyboard and 
    // returns it as a text String

    // The := symbol declares a new variable.
    userName := io.readLine();

    // We can send multiple parameters to the print function, and they will all
    // get printed with a space character separating them
    print("Hello,", userName);
    print("How old are you?");
   
    // The Int::convert function converts it's input into an integer number.
    // What does the '::' thing mean? Don't worry about that right now, we'll 
    // get to it later...
    userAge := Int::convert(io.readLine());

    print(
        "Wow, that means you've been alive for more than", 
        userAge*365*24*60*60, "seconds. That's a lot of time...");
}
	  </pre>
	  <p>
	    The <code>:=</code> operator is used to <em>declare</em> a
	    new variable. A variable is a named thing that holds a
	    value. Declaring a variables means that we create a new
	    variable and assign it an initial value. Later on we can
	    access the value of a variable by writing out it's
	    name. For example, the
	    line <code class="anna-code">userName :=
	    io.readLine();</code> declares a new variable
	    named <code>userName</code>, and assigns it an initial
	    value by reading a line of input from the keyboard. A few
	    lines later, the
	    code <code class="anna-code">print("Hello,",
	    userName);</code> will print whatever the user entered on
	    the keyboard back onto the screen.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    <code>io</code> is an Anna module. A module is something
	    that is used to group together related pieces of code,
	    such as functions. The <code>io</code> module contains
	    code that deals with Input and Output, that is, reading
	    and writing stuff. Modules make life easier because we
	    don't have to be afraid of naming clashes when two
	    different pieces of code give different variables the same
	    name.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    <em class="task">Exercise 2:</em> Write a program that
	    asks the user what his/her favourite hobby is and tells
	    them that it's boring.

	  <h1><a name="conditionals">if, while and each</a></h1>
	  <p>
	    Our next example shows you how to conditionally do things, as well as how to repeat stuff.
	  </p>
	  <pre class="anna-code">
def main()
{
    print("What is your name?");
    userName := io.readLine();
    // Give a special greeting to people named Anna
    if(userName == "Anna")
    {
        print("Wow, what a pretty name. Lovely to meet you, Anna!");
    }
    else
    {
        print("Hi,", userName);
    }

    print("Pick a number. Any number.");
    // Repeat the same piece of code while a condition is met
    // In this case, we read a new number from the keyboard until we encounter 
    // the number seven.
    while(Int::convert(io.readLine()) != 7)
    {
        print("No no no. Bad number. Pick something else.");
    }
    print("Seven! I knew it! I knew it all along!");

    (99..0).each(bottles)
    {
        suffix := "";
        if(bottles > 1)
        {
            print(bottles, "bottles of beer on the wall,", bottles, "bottles of beer.");            if(bottles > 2)
            {
                suffix = "" ~ (bottles-1) ~ " bottles of beer on the wall.";

        print("--")
