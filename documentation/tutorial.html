	    </li>
	  </ul>
	    
	  <h2><a name="install-ubuntu">Installing Anna under Ubuntu</a></h2>
	  <p>
	    The first step of installing Anna is to install the various prerequisites. On the command line, enter the following command:
	  </p>
	  <pre>
sudo apt-get install gcc bison flex libgmp3-dev make gettext git-core
	  </pre>
	  <p>
	    The next step is to download the Anna source:
	  </p>
	  <pre>
git clone git://github.com/liljencrantz/anna.git
	  </pre>
	  <p>
	    After that, you'll need to compile Anna:
	  </p>
	  <pre>
cd anna; make -s
	  </pre>
	  <p>
	    If everything went well, you should now have compiled the
	    Anna executable. To install it, type:
	  </p>
	  <pre>
sudo make install
	  </pre>
	  <p>
	    That should be everything you need to get Anna installed
	    on your system. <a href='#hello'>Click here to proceed

	  <h2><a name="install-generic">Generic install instructions</a></h2>
	  <p>
	    The first step of installing Anna is to install the
	    various prerequisites. Anna should compile using a
	    resonably modern version of either GCC or LLVM, and
	    requires Flex, Bison, GMP (the GNU Multiple Precision
	    arithmetic library), GNU make and GNU gettext. The Anna
	    source code is version controlled using git, so you will
	    need that as well. Hos to install these prerequisites
	    depends on what platform you're using, please consult you
	    operating system documentation if you're unsure.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    The next step is to download the Anna source:

	    If everything went well, you should now have compiled the
	    Anna executable. To install it, run <code>make
	    install</code> as root.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    That should be everything you need to get Anna installed

	  </p>

	  <h1><a name="hello">Lesson 1: Hello world</a></h1>
	  <p>
	    Let's start out with an interactive Anna session. Just
	    open a command line prompt and type <code>anna</code>, and
	    Anna should start:
	  </p>
	  <pre>
# anna
Welcome to anna!

Type «help» for more information.
anna&gt;
	  </pre>
	  <p>
	    Try to enter a few commands and see what happens:
	  </p>
	  <pre>
anna&gt; 1
1
anna&gt; 1+1
2
anna&gt; "hello"
hello
anna&gt; "Hello, " ~ "world!"
Hello, world!
	  </pre>
	  <p>
	    As you can see, the Anna interpreter can be used as a
	    calculator. Any code you enter is evaluated, and the
	    result is printed to the screen. Play around for a bit and
	    see what you can find out.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Ok, that's it for the interactive prompt for now. Exit by
	    writing the word <code>exit</code> and pressing enter and
	    open your favorite text editor.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    The first Anna program you will write will simply write
	    the text «Hello, world!» on the screen:
	  </p>
	  <pre class="anna-code">
def main()
{
    print("Hello, world!");
}
	  </pre>
	  <p>
	    Let's go over this example in detail.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    First of all, all Anna code consists of
	    functions. Functions are self contained pieces of code. To
	    define a function, you write something
	    like <code class="anna-code">def
	    functionName(){...}</code>.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    The second thing to learn is that when executing a
	    program, the function named main in the file that is to be
	    executed will be called.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Finally, we've learned that there is a function
	    named <code>print</code>, that will output its arguments
	    to the screen.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    <em class="anna-task">Exercise 1:</em> Save the example above
	    in a file titled <code>hello.anna</code> and try running
	    it by executing the command <code>anna hello.anna</code>
	    from the directory where you saved your file.
	  </p>

	  <h1><a name="variables">Lesson 2: Numbers, variables and arithmetic</a></h1>
	  <p>
	    Our next example is a program that holds a simple conversation with the user:
	  </p>
	  <pre class="anna-code">
def main()
{
    print("What is your name?");
    // The readLine.readLine function reads one line of input from the keyboard and 
    // returns it as a text String

    // Use the := symbol to declare a new variable.
    userName := readLine.readLine("> ");

    // And now that the userName variable has a value, we can use it. 
    // For example, we can print it!
    print("Hello,", userName);
    print("How old are you?");
   
    // The Int::convert function converts it's input into an integer number.
    // What does the '::' thing mean? Don't worry about that right now, we'll 
    // get to it later...
    userAge := Int::convert(readLine.readLine("> "));

    print(
        "Wow, that means you've been alive for more than", 
        userAge*365*24*60*60, "seconds. That's a lot of time...");
}
	  </pre>
	  <p>
	    The <code>:=</code> operator is used to <em>declare</em> a
	    new variable. A variable is a named thing that holds a
	    value. Declaring a variables means that we create a new
	    variable and assign it an initial value. Later on we can
	    access the value of a variable by writing out it's
	    name. For example, the
	    line <code class="anna-code">userName :=
	    readLine.readLine("> ");</code> declares a new variable
	    named <code>userName</code>, and assigns it an initial
	    value by reading a line of input from the keyboard. A few
	    lines later, the
	    code <code class="anna-code">print("Hello,",
	    userName);</code> will print whatever the user entered on
	    the keyboard back onto the screen.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    <code>readLine</code> is an Anna module. A module is
	    something that is used to group together related pieces of
	    code, such as functions. The <code>readLine</code> module
	    contains code that deals with reading input from the
	    keayboard. Modules make life easier because we don't have
	    to be afraid of naming clashes when two different pieces
	    of code give different variables the same name.

	    Hint for Exercise 2: In the example above, we used the

	  <p>
	    Our next example shows you how to conditionally do things, as well as how to repeat stuff.
	  </p>
	  <pre class="anna-code">
def main()
{
    print("What is your name?");
    userName := readLine.readLine("> ");
    // Give a special greeting to people with lovely names
    if(userName == "Anna")
    {
        print("Wow, what a pretty name. Lovely to meet you, Anna!");
    }
    else
    {

    }

    print("Pick a number. Any number.");
    // Repeat the same piece of code while a condition is met
    // In this case, we read a new number from the keyboard until we encounter 
    // the number seven.
    while(Int::convert(readLine.readLine("> ")) != 7)
    {
        print("No no no. Bad number. Pick something else.");
    }
    print("Seven! I knew it! I knew it all along!");

    // Loop over the vakues 0 (inclusive) to 10 (exclusive)
    (0..10).each(index)
    {
        print("This is number", index+1);
    }
}
	  </pre>
	  <p>
	    In the above code snipet, we compare two numbers with the
	    operator <code>!=</code>, which returns true if two
	    objects are different. The other comparison operators
	    are <code>==</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&gt;=</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, <code>&lt;</code>. They
	    are used for testing equality, greater than, greater than
	    or equal, les than or equal and less than, respectively.

	  <h1><a name="modules">Lesson 5: More on modules and the use expression</a></h1>
	  <p>
	    We already mentioned modules in a previous section. This
	    section will talk more about modules and how to work
	    efficiently with them.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Like was said before, modules group related code into
	    chunks. For example, there is a module named date, which
	    contains functions relating to dates, time, time zones and
	    so on. <a href="api/global/date/index.html">This is the
	    documentation for the date module</a>. For a list of more
	    modules, see the <a href="api/global/index.html">global
	    API index</a>.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Browsing the API documentation can be a useful way to get
	    to know the tools you have to work with. But sometimes it
	    is easier to explore the modules interactively. Start the
	    interactive Anna prompt by typing <code>anna</code> at the
	    command line prompt. Then try out the following:
	  </p>
	  <pre>
help(lang) // This will show a short help text on the «lang» module

dir(lang) // This will list all the members of the lang module

help(Int) // This will show a help text on how to use the Int, the integer number type.

help(1) // Like the above, this will also show a help text on how to use the Int.
	  </pre>
	  
	  <p>
	    <em class="anna-task">Exercise 5 a:</em> Use the command
	    line to try and find out if there is a method for sorting
	    a list.
	  </p>

	    onclick='javascript:anna.togglePopup("#anna-answer5a-toggle");'>Click

	  </p>

	  <div class='anna-code-popup' id='anna-answer5a-toggle' style='display: none;'>
	    <div class='anna-code-popup-inner'>
              <span class='anna-code-popup-close'>X</span>
	      <h3>Answer for exercise 5</h3>
	      The <code>sort</code> method returns fits the bill.
	    </div>
	  </div>
	  
	  <p>
	    One thing you may have noted above is that a module
	    behaves mostly like any other object in Anna. For example,
	    we can send a module into the <code>help</code>
	    or <code>dir</code> functions to obtain information on
	    them. In fact, an Anna module is nothing other than a
	    plain old object that you can do everything with that you
	    can do with other objects.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    One thing about having modules, though, is that the typing
	    might get boring.If we're going to use a bunch of
	    different calls from e.g. the <code>unix.user</code> module, we
	    can end up with code that looks like this:
	  </p>
	  
	  <pre class="anna-code">
myUserId := unix.user.getuid();
myGroupId := unix.user.getgid();
if(myGroupId in listOfReallyCoolGroups)
{
    unix.user.setuid(reallyCoolUser);
}
	  </pre>
	  <p>
	    Note how many times we had to type unix.user in the above code. We can do better:
	  </p>
	  <pre class="anna-code">
use(unix.user);
myUserId := getuid();
myGroupId := getgid();
if(myGroupId in listOfReallyCoolGroups)
{
    setuid(reallyCoolUser);
}
	  </pre>
	  <p>
	    That's a lot less to type. The <code>use</code> expression
	    can really save your fingers, but be careful!
	    Overusing <code>use</code> will turn your code into an
	    unmaintainable mess as it becomes trickier to figure out
	    where a specific function comes from.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Remember how we said before that modules are just plain
	    old objects. If that was true, we should be able to
	    use <code>use</code> expressions for other things than
	    modules. Let's try!
	  </p>
	  <pre class="anna-code">
use([1, 2, 3]);
print(count);  // Prints the count of elements in the list, which is 3
	  </pre>
	  <p>
	    Yes! We can use the <code>use</code> clause to save
	    ourself the typing of any long paths, not just modules.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    When exploring Anna, you may have noticed that there is a
	    module named lang, and that it's content may sem
	    familiar. The lang module contains the print function, the
	    Int type and a bunch of other stuff that we've used a
	    bunch of times without having to write out
	    e.g. <code>lang.print</code>. How come? You may already
	    suspect the answer - a use clause. This is correct. The
	    Anna compiler will implicitly insert
	    <code>use(lang);</code> at the top of every module it
	    compiles.
	  </p>

	  <h1><a name="assigning">Lesson 6: Assigning new values to
	  variables</a></h1>
	  <p>
	    We saw before that we can declare a new variable using the
	    declaration operator, <code>:=</code>. To declare a new
	    variable called seasons, and give it the value 4, we
	    write <code>seasons := 4</code>. If, down the line, we
	    want to change the value of an already existing variable,
	    we use the assignment operator, <code>=</code>. For
	    example, to reassign the value 2 to the variable seasons,
	    write <code>seasons = 2</code>. 
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Anna also supports the notion of constants. Constants work
	    exactly like variables, except the assignment operator
	    (<code>=</code>) doesn't work on them. Once you're created
	    a constant, it's initial value never changes. To create a
	    new constant, use the <code>:==</code> operator, for
	    example, <code>seasons :== 4</code>.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    It is possible in Anna to declare or assign to multiple values in the same expression, simply use code like this:
	  </p>
	  <pre class="anna-code">
// Declare two variables, someVariable and anotherVariable, to hold the values 
// 1 and 2, respectively.
[someVariable, anotherVariable] := [1, 2];

// This code switches places between the two variables
[someVariable, anotherVariable] = [anotherVariable, someVariable];

	  <h1><a name="iterating">Lesson 7: Iterating</a></h1>
	  <p>
	    We've mentioned Lists and Strings in previous
	    sections. These are two examples of so called
	    collections. Collections are types of object that contain
	    arbitrarily many objects of the same type. A string is a
	    collection of characters, for example. Collection types
	    support various ways to apply an operation to all of their
	    elements:
	  </p>
	  <pre class="anna-code">
myList := [1, 5, 7]

/*
  We've already seen the each method in action in section 3. The each method 
  calls the block supplied to it once for each element in the collection.

  This will print "Value: 1", "Value: 5" and "Value: 7" on separate lines.
*/
myList.each(value){ print("Value:", value) }

/*
  In the above example, we supplied one name within parentesis. If we
  do so, that will be the name of the value supplied to the block. We
  can also call each with two arguments, in which case the first one
  is the index, and the second one is the value.

  This will print "0 =&gt; 1", "1 =&gt; 5" and "2 =&gt; 7" on separate lines.
*/
myList.each(key, value){ print(key, "=&gt;", value) }

/*
  There are many other usefil iteration functions that work the same way, but
  return new collections based on the return value of the block.
  
  The map method creates a new collection with the values returned by the 
  block.

  This prints [2, 6, 8]
*/
print(myList.map(value){ value+1 }


/*
  The filter method returns all values of the original collection where the block
  returns true

  This prints [2, 5]
*/
print(myList.filter(value){ value &lt; 6 }

/*
  The find method returns the first value of the original collection where the block
  returns true

  This prints 2
*/
print(myList.find(value){ value &lt; 6 }

	  </pre>
	  <p>
	    Back in section 3, when we first mentioned the each method, we used the following code snippet:
	  </p>
	  <pre class="anna-code">
    (0..10).each(index)
    {
        print("This is number", index+1);
    }
	  </pre>
	  <p>
	    What exactly is the <code>0..10</code> part? The answer is that it is a Range. Ranges, like lists and strings, are a collection, and ranges support map, each, filter and all the other collection iteration methods. A Range is a collection of equally spaced integers. Here are some more examples of Range objects:
	  </p>
	  <pre>
anna&gt; 0..5; 
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4}
anna&gt; 5..0;
[5 ,4 ,3 ,2 ,1]
anna&gt; 0..10|3 
[0, 3, 6, 9]
anna&gt; 5...   // This Range has no end. Careful about using it in an iterator!
[5, 6, 7...]
anna&gt; 5|2...
[5, 7, 9...]
	  </pre>
	  <p>
	    One very useful thing that we can do with ranges is to create slices of lists and strings. For example, <code class="anna-code">"Hello"[1...]</code> will return <code class="anna-code">"ello"</code>.

	  <h1><a name="functions">Lesson 8: Defining your own functions and dealing with types</a></h1>
	  <p>
	    Let's look a bit closer at functions! We have already
	    called several functions with parameters, such as
	    the <code>print</code> function. Here is our own function
	    definition which accepts an argument:
	  </p>
	  <pre class="anna-code">
// Print all elements of the Fibonacci sequence up to the secified number
def fibonacci(Int end){ 
    [first, second] := [0, 1];
    while(first <= end)
    {
        print(first, end: " ");
        [first, second] = [second, first+second];
    }
    print();
}
fibonacci(100); // Prints «0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89»
	  </pre>
	  <p>
	    The first new thing in the above function is the argument
	    part to the function header, <code>(Int
	    end)</code>. Hopefully, you figured out that this means
	    that the fibonacci function expects exactly one argument,
	    and it must be of the type Int. This is the first real
	    encounter with typing we've encountered in Anna, but if
	    you've played around a bit during the exercises, you've
	    probably bumped into types of variables on you own. Much
	    like function arguments, variables are type checked:
	  </p>
	  <pre>
anna &gt; myVariable := 1+2;
3
anna &gt; myVariable = "Hello"
Error in file «<internal>», on line 1:

Invalid type in assignment. Expected argument of type Int, but supplied value of type ImutableString does not qualify.

Error: Found 1 error(s) during module loading
	  </pre>
	  <p>
	    What this means is that when we first create the variable
	    myVariable, Anna checks what the type of the
	    expression <code>1+2</code> is, and
	    makes <code>myVariable</code> into a variable of that
	    type. Any future assignments must also be to variables of
	    that type.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    For every expersion in the Anna source code, the compiler
	    will always obtain some notion of the type of the
	    output. Languages that do this are called «statically
	    typed». We will get back to this concept later on in the
	    tutorial, but for now, let's just mention a few types that
	    might be useful to know about.
	  </p>

	      <h3>Suggested answer for exercise 7</h3>
	      <p>
		There are many possible solutions to this exercise. Some of them are presented below.
	      </p>

	      <pre class="anna-code">
def lower(String in)
{
    "".join(in.map(chr){chr.lower})
}

def lower(String in)
{
    result := "";
    in.each(ch){ result ~= chr.lower }
    return result;
}
	      </pre>
	    </div>
	  </div>


	  <h2><a name="functions-default">Functions with default arguments</a></h2>
	  <p>
	    It is sometimes useful to specify a default value for one
	    or more arguments. This creates a function that can be
	    called with fewer arguments than it is defined to
	    allow. For example:
	  </p>
	  <pre class="anna-code">
def askOk(String prompt, Int retries=4, String complaint='Yes or no, please!')
{
    while(1)
    {
        ok := rreadLine.readLine(prompt);
        if(ok in ["y", "ye", "yes"])
        {
            return 1;
        }
        if(ok in ["n", "no", "nop", "nope"])
        {
            return ?;
        }
        retries = retries - 1;
        if(retries &lt; 0)
	{
            raise(error.Error('Uncooperative user');
        }
        print(complaint);
    }
}
	  </pre>
	  
	  <p>
	    This function can be called in several ways:
	  </p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>
	      giving only the mandatory argument: <code class="anna-code">askOk("Do you really want to quit?")</code>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      giving one of the optional arguments: <code class="anna-code">askOk("OK to overwrite the file?", 2)</code>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      or even giving all arguments: <code class="anna-code">askOk("OK to overwrite the file?", 2, "Come on, only yes or no!")</code>
	    </li>
	  </ul>

	  This example also introduces the in keyword. This tests
	  whether or not a sequence contains a certain value.

	  <h2><a name="functions-kw">Function calls with keyword arguments</a></h2>
	  <p>
	    Functions can also be called using keyword arguments of
	    the form <code>kwarg:value</code>. For instance, the above
	    askOk function call definied in the previous section can
	    be called in any of the following ways:
	  </p>
	  <pre class="anna-code">
askOk("Do you want to quit?");
askOk(prompt: "Do you want to quit?");
askOk(prompt: "Do you want to quit?", complaint: "What do you mean? Answer yes or no, please!");
askOk("Do you want to quit?", retries: 1);
askOk(retries: 1, "Quit?");
	  </pre>
	  <p>
	    But none of the following are valid:
	  </p>
	  <pre class="anna-code">
askOk();                   // Required argument missing
askOk(greeting: "Hello");  // Unknown keyword argument
	  </pre>
	  <p>
	    Keyword arguments and non-keyword arguments can be given
	    in any order. The compiler will first go over all keyword
	    arguemtns and map them to the corresponding argument
	    position, and after that, all positional arguments are
	    mapped to the first free argument.
	  </p>

	  <h2><a name="functions-vararg">Functions with arbitrary argument lists</a></h2>
	  <p>
	    Finally, it is possible to specify that a function can be
	    called with an arbitrary number of arguments. These
	    arguments will be wrapped up in a list. Before the
	    variable number of arguments, zero or more normal
	    arguments may occur.
	  </p>
	  <pre class="anna-code">
def writeMultipleItems(io.File file, String separator, Object args...)
{
    file.writeFile(separator.join(args));
}
	  </pre>
	  <p>
	    In the same fashion, dictionaries can deliver keyword arguments with the :-operator:
	  </p>
	  <pre class="anna-code">
def writeMapping(Object: arbitraryMapping)
{
    arbitraryMapping.each(key, value)
    {
        print(key, "=&gt;", value);
    }
}

writeMapping(foo: 1, bar: "Hello", baz: 0..5);
	  </pre>
	  <p>
	    You may have already suspected as much, but the print function accepts arbitrary arguments. All non-mapping arguments are printed. You can specify the separator between arguments with the named argument <code>sep</code>, and the last thing to print with the named argument <code>end</code>. The default value for sep is a space, and for end a newline character.
	  </p>
	  <pre>
anna&gt; print
def ImutableList (String keys:, Object param...)
anna&gt; print(1,2,3, sep:"a", end:"b")
1a2a3b[1, 2, 3]
