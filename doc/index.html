<h2>Anna in a single sentence</h2>
<p>
Anna is a statically duck typed computer language that supports LISP
style macros, functions and types as first class citizens, inner
functions and continuations; it has a C-style syntax and it's aim is
to combine the expressiveness and power of LISP and Ruby with the type
safety and control of Java.
</p>
<p>
Note the use of a semicolon to combine two separate sentences into
something that works around the originally stated limitations and
manages to be readable. You will see a lot more of that in Anna.

<h2>Anna for LISP programmers</h2>

<p>
  Anna is a statically typed LISP-like language with a front end that
  allows you to write code with a C-like syntax. The Anna type system
  supports duck typing, meaning that if the type of variable B
  contains all members of the type A, with compatible type signatures,
  then B can be freely cast into a variable of type A.
