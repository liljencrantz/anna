<p>
The first step of installing Anna is to install the various prerequisites. On the command line, enter the following command:
</p>
<pre>
sudo apt-get install gcc bison flex libgmp3-dev make gettext git-core
</pre>
<p>
The next step is to download the Anna source:
</p>
<pre>
git clone git://github.com/liljencrantz/anna.git
</pre>
<p>
After that, you'll need to compile Anna:
</p>
<pre>
cd anna; make -s
</pre>
<p>
If everything went well, you should now have compiled the Anna executable. To install it, type:
</p>
<pre>
make install
</pre>
<p>
That should be everything you need to get Anna installed on your system. <a href='hello'>Click here to proceed with the tutorial</a>.
</p>

<h1><a name="hello">Hello world</a></h1>
<p>
The first Anna example will simply write the words «Hello world» on the screen:
</p>
<pre>
def main()
{
    print("Hello, world!");
}
</pre>
<p>
Let's go over this example in detail.
</p>
<p>
First of all, all Anna code consists of functions. Functions are self contained pieces of code. To define a function, you write something like <code class="anna-code">def functionName(){...}</code>. 
</p>
<p>
The second thing to learn is that when executing a program, the function named main will be executed.
</p>
<p>
Finally, we've learned that there is a function named echo, that will output its arguments to the screen.
