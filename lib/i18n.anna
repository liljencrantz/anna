The anna i18n module (i18n is short for internationalization) is a simple high level module for making an Anna program available in different languages.","To use the i18n module, the follow the steps outlined below:","
First, annotate any strings in your program that you want to be translatable, by prefixing them with the letter 't'. You will also need to macro-expand using the i18n module. A simple file might look like this:",

The next step is to run the annaxgettext application on your source files. Use a command like this:
</p>
<pre>
annaxgettext myApplication.anna >messages.pot
</pre>
<p>
The above command will create a file named messages.pot, looking something like this:
</p>
<pre>

msgid \"\"
msgstr \"\"
\"Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8\\n\"

#: myApplication.anna:4
msgid \"Hello, world!\\x0a\"
msgstr \"\"
</pre>
<p>
